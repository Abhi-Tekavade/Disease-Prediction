# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a system for predicting diseases based on patient symptoms and medical data, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate and early detection of diseases, improving healthcare outcomes and reducing the burden on medical staff.

## Motivation
The increasing prevalence of diseases and the recent impact of the Covid-19 pandemic highlight the need for early disease prediction. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze large volumes of patient treatment history and health data to identify hidden patterns and predict diseases with greater accuracy. This can aid in timely diagnosis, reduce overcrowding in hospitals, lower treatment costs, and ultimately save lives.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of supervised machine learning algorithms in improving healthcare through accurate and early disease detection. Multiple ML models will be investigated for each disease recognition problem to ensure comprehensive and precise results. The analysis will focus on diseases related to the heart, kidney, breast, and brain.

## Methodology
The project will involve the following steps:
1. Literature Survey: Conduct a thorough review of existing studies and research papers related to disease prediction using machine learning.
2. Data Collection: Gather relevant datasets containing patient symptoms, medical history, and disease labels.
3. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its suitability for training ML models.
4. Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features from the data to facilitate disease prediction.
5. Model Evaluation: Utilize supervised ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) to train and evaluate disease prediction models.
6. Performance Analysis: Compare and assess the performance of different ML models for each disease category.
7. Conclusion: Summarize the findings and identify the best performing ML models for accurate disease detection.
